I want to create a Drupal 10 website integrated with Civicrm 6.5 running in a local docker container linux VM.
Create a Dockerfile and related files based on ../drupal11civicrm5/. 
I want to use drush and composer to install civicrm and get a running Drupal 10 + Civicrm 6.5 instance. I want to use drush to install, not the UI.

Later,
in directory ../drupal7_civicrm_webform_demo I have a separate docker VM with drupal 7 and civicrm 5 and some demo civicrm webforms.

I plan to try converting these and importing them to the Drupal 10 + Civicrm 6.5 running in this directory with assistance from Claude for the data conversion and migration process.
